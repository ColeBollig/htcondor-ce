# Warning: JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS, JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES, JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_CMD, and
#          JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_FILE are deprecated and will be removed for V24 of
#          HTCondor. New configuration syntax for the job router is defined using
#          JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES and JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_<name>. For new syntax example visit:
# https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grid-computing/job-router.html#an-example-configuration
#   Note: The removal will occur earlier in the development series HTCondor V23.
