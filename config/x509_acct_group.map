# HTCondor-CE file for mapping X.509 subject DNs or VOMS first FQANs
# to accounting groups. Each mapping has the following format:
#
# * "Subject DN or VOMS attribute" AcctGroup
#
# Optionally, you may specify the second field as a regular expression
# by enclosing it in '/'. For example, the following would set the
# AcctGroup attribute of the routed job to 'opportunistic.osg' for
# incoming jobs with a proxy whose subject DN or VOMS first FQAN
# starts with '/osg/':
#
# * /^\/osg\/.*/ opportunistic.osg
#
# See upstream documentation for formatting details:
