# HTCondor-CE file for mapping local usernames to accounting groups. Each
# mapping has the following format:
#
# * username AcctGroup
#
# Optionally, you may specify the username as a regular expression by enclosing
# the username in '/'. For example, the following would set the AcctGroup
# attribute of the routed job to 'physics.usatlas' for incoming jobs mapped to a
# local, numbered 'usatlas' user:
#
# * /^usatlas[0-9]+$/ physics.usatlas
#
# See upstream documentation for formatting details:
